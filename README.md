# Gigabyte Aorus Z390 Pro i7-9700K RX580
### Introduction

This repository is **explicitly** designed for Aorus Z390 Pro i7-9700K RX580 to run Catalina 10.15.[1-2] with no hassle. However, due to the time constraint, a step by step installation guide won't be covered in this guide. For more information (regarding installation), please check [[Guide] Creating OSX Installer by Rehabman](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/) or installing [Mojave 10.15.x](https://mirrors.dtops.cc/iso/MacOS/daliansky_macos/) with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

### Specs

- **Gigabyte Aorus Z390 Pro (M.2 Key B * 2 + PCIe 3.0 x16 * 2 + PCIe2.0 x16 *1)**
- **Intel i7-9700K** (4.9GHz GHz OC, SMBIOS **iMac19,1**)
- **OpenCore** (0.5.6)
- **Be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4** (250w TDP, highly recommended)
- **Ballistix DDR4 3200MHz 8G * 2** (Overclocked to 3200MHz)
- **WD Black 2018/PC SN720 NVMe 1T SSD**
- **Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ 8G** (*BruceX 5K* Apple Res 422 Master Exporting time 8s, connected to 4K monitor via a DP-mDP cable)
- **Apple BCM94360CD** Wi-Fi/Bluetooth + [M.2 NGFF Key A+E Adapter](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/BCM94360CS2-BCM943224PCIEBT2-12-6-Pin-WIFI-wireless-card-module-to-NGFF-M-2/223633015347?hash=item3411910233:g:clQAAOSwI7lcld~Z) 
- **USB3.1 Gen2 to PCIe Card** (ASM1142 chip-based)



### What works

- **dGPU** Hardware Accelaration  (Final Cut Pro X, VideoProc, Compressor tested)
- **AirDrop, Handoff** (Apple Wi-Fi/Bluetooth required)
- **SideCar** (with an Apple BT/Wi-FI card both wired or wireless would work)
- **iMessage** (SystemProductName, SystemSerialNumber, MLB, SystemUUID, are required) 
- **All Rear USB3.1 USB2.0 Type-C/Type-A Ports** (few USB2.0 ports disabled) 
- **HDMI Audio** (**Sound Control** is required to adjust volume)
- **Onboard HD Audio** (Realtek alc892, layout id: 1)
- **USB 3.1 Gen2** (may require a USB3.1 Gen2 to PCIe Card, i.g. ASM1142 chip-based)

### Bugs 

- **Safari Netflix won't work with my RX580**, but it might work on navi GPUs (e.g. RX5700XT)
- **Sidecar** and **HEVC** seemed boken on Catalina 10.15.3
- **Using boot-arg shikigva value and Set to Yes Automatic Platform will Netflix in Safari and Sidecar worked

### Deployment

#### 1. BIOS Firmware and Settings

I would highly suggest you to upgrade you BIOS firmware to **12d** and apply the profile I created in the `/repositoryRoot/BIOS/`. This would allows you to unlock your motherboard CFG, allowing you to use native NVRAM. 

1. Clone the repository

2. Copy `EFI` and `BIOS` to your EFI formatted USB flash. (usually needs to be mounted via, for instance:
```bash
sudo diskutil mount disk2s1 (disk2s1 shall be replaced by your USB identifier)
```
3. Reboot your PC, press `F8` to enter `Q-Flash`, choose from `USB` and select `/BIOS/Z390AORP.12d`
4. (Wait util it gets done)
5. Enters BIOS setting again and load the BIOS profile: either `Profile_noCFG_noOC` (if you do not expect to overclock your CPU)
6. Reboot.


### 2. macOS Installation

#### Option 1: GUI (recommended)

- [Mojave 10.15.2 Download](https://mirrors.dtops.cc/iso/MacOS/daliansky_macos/) (*expired, will be fixed later on*)
- [Install macOS with etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

#### Option 2: Command-line

- Download Mojave 10.15.2 from App Store
- [[Guide] Creating OSX Installer by Rehabman](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/) 

### 3. Fixing iServices

To use Apple services, you need to have a vaild but unregistered serial (consisting of four attributes, shown as below) patched in your config.plist. For more editing details, please check wiki page: [How to fix iServices](https://github.com/sarkrui/Hackintosh-Z390-Aorus-Pro-9700K-RX580/wiki/How-to-fix-iServices)

```bash
Type = SystemProductName
Serial = SystemSerialNumber
Board Serial = MLB
SmUUID = SystemUUID
```

### 4. Dual Boot (Windows)

Using motherboard boot menu would disrupt the deflaut booting order, to resolve so, using OpenCore to boot Windows Boot Manager is one solution. You only need to add a boot entry for your Windows Boot Manager EFI. For more details, please check wiki page: [How to add a boot entry](https://github.com/sarkrui/Hackintosh-Z390-Aorus-Pro-9700K-RX580/wiki/How-to-add-a-boot-entry-in-OpenCore)
